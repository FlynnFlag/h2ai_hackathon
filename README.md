## Topic 3 Patient Navigation Informed by Risk Calculator

Empower patients to route themselves in a timely fashion to the medical specialist or facility that is best-suited to address their symptoms.

## Overview
Our COPD Health Assistant is an AI-driven chatbot designed to empower patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) by providing them with personalized health monitoring and management tools. The chatbot utilizes a user-friendly interface to interpret responses from the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and additional health metrics to provide a comprehensive view of the patient's health, advising on when to seek medical attention.

## Technical Vigor
- Technology Stack: Built using Python for backend services, React for the front end, and integrated with Google Cloud's Dialogflow for natural language processing to power the chatbot.
- Data Handling: Utilizes secure cloud storage to manage patient data with encryption in transit and at rest, adhering to HIPAA compliance standards for data security and privacy.
Integration: Connects with external APIs such as the BetterDoctor API for location-based specialist recommendations and scheduling.

## Clinical Validity
- Assessment Tools: Incorporates the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) to regularly gauge symptom severity and integrates additional diagnostic questions developed in collaboration with pulmonary specialists.
- Clinical Endorsements: Developed under the advisory of a board of respiratory therapists and pulmonologists to ensure clinical accuracy and relevance.
- Testing and Validation: Piloted with a control group of COPD patients, demonstrating a significant improvement in patient self-reporting accuracy and adherence to treatment plans.

## Business Viability
- Market Need: Addresses a critical need for over 16 million Americans diagnosed with COPD, focusing on improving quality of life and reducing hospital readmissions.
- Revenue Model: Operates on a subscription basis for patients, with an additional licensing model for healthcare providers and institutions.
Partnerships and Growth: In talks with healthcare providers and insurance companies to include our tool in their COPD care strategies, aiming for widespread adoption and integration.

## Patient-Centered Perspective
- User Experience Design: Features an intuitive, conversational interface that simplifies complex medical information, making it accessible and manageable for patients of all ages and tech-savviness.
- Personalization: Tailors recommendations based on individual patient responses, health history, and preferences, promoting greater personal engagement and proactive health management.
- Support and Education: Provides ongoing educational content about COPD management, lifestyle tips, and direct access to support networks and medical professionals.

## AI Safety and Ethics
- Transparency: Clearly communicates the AI's function, the origin of its advice, and the distinction between AI-generated recommendations and direct medical advice.
- Bias Mitigation: Regularly updated algorithms to avoid bias in treatment recommendations, with data continually reviewed for diversity and inclusivity.
User Consent and Privacy: Ensures user consent for data collection and use, with strict adherence to data privacy laws and patient rights to data access and deletion.

## Conclusion
Our COPD Health Assistant aims to transform how COPD patients manage their disease by providing a smart, user-friendly tool that guides them in understanding their health better and making informed decisions about when to seek medical help. Our project prioritizes patient empowerment, clinical accuracy, and secure, ethical AI use, striving to set a new standard in patient-centered digital health tools.
